# Miniengine #

Miniengine is a C++ layer on top of SDL and OpenGL to help create games or visual applications.
It only provides the basic GPU abstraction (Meshes, Textures, Shaders, Application) and a basic SceneGraph.


## Installation ##

It comes with a Visual Studio 2010 solution, but the code should compile in any platform that supports SDL.
The libs and DLLs are not provided with the source code, please download SDL2 from https://www.libsdl.org/download-2.0.php and copy the libs in the libs/lib folder
The DLLs should be copyed in the root folder.
